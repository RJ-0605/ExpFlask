make sure you include the new username and new password when connecting to my sql on your machine

(mysql -u YOUR_SYSTEM_USER)




use this to display users and their plugins

$ sudo mysql -u root # I had to use "sudo" since is new installation

mysql> USE mysql;
mysql> SELECT User, Host, plugin FROM mysql.user;
